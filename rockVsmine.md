Overview of project-
Suppose there is a war going on between two countries and one countries submarine is secretly trying to enter into another countries ocean boudaries but the other country has mines
which are located underwater. However there are rocks too in the ocean which may look like mine
so using this data collected from sonar - sound navigation and ranging technology on submarine we try to predict that whether the given particle is a rock or mine
here we have 208 data sets which i know are low but it works for the training part as we are only going to use 10% of that data and as we can see there in the code that our model
has pretty good accuracy.
here i have used numpy, pandas and sklearn and this project is based on LR prediction model which is best for binary data.
