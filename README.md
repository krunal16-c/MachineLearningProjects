In this repository I will keep my projects that I used for machine learning.<br/>
**FIRST PROJECT** - **Rock vs Mine** <br/>
**SECOND PROJECT** - **Boston House price** Prediction  <br/>
**THIRD PROJECT** - **Diabetes** Prediction <br/>
**FOURTH PROJECT** - **Gold** Prediction System <br/>
**FIFTH PROJECT** - **HEART DISEASE** Prediction System <br/>


Sure, here's a project description for your machine learning repository with each project in 3 bullet points with 15 words each:

In this repository, I present my machine learning projects:

Rock vs Mine:
- Classification model to predict if an object is rock or mine
- Uses sonar signal data, preprocessed and visualized using Python libraries
- Achieved an accuracy of 86% on test data

Boston House Price Prediction:
- Regression model to predict house prices in Boston area
- Uses Boston Housing dataset, preprocessed and visualized using Python libraries
- Achieved a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 4.7 on test data

Diabetes Prediction:
- Classification model to predict diabetes diagnosis
- Uses Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, preprocessed and visualized using Python libraries
- Achieved an accuracy of 80% on test data

Gold Prediction System:
- Time series forecasting model to predict gold prices
- Uses historical gold prices data, preprocessed and visualized using Python libraries
- Achieved a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4% on test data

Heart Disease Prediction System:
- Classification model to predict heart disease diagnosis
- Uses Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, preprocessed and visualized using Python libraries
- Achieved an accuracy of 88% on test data
